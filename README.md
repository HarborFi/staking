# Quads 

Quads is an ERC 20 smart contract developed using the brownie framework.

# External Libraries

This project relies on OpenZeppelin libraries version v4.3.1.

> npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

## Basic Use

To interact with a deployed contract in a local environment, start by opening the console:

```bash
brownie console
```

Next, deploy a test token:

```python
>>> token = Token.deploy("Test Token", "TST", 18, 1e21, {'from': accounts[0]})

Transaction sent: 0x4a61edfaaa8ba55573603abd35403cf41291eca443c983f85de06e0b119da377
  Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 12000000
  Token.constructor confirmed - Block: 1   Gas used: 521513 (4.35%)
  Token deployed at: 0xd495633B90a237de510B4375c442C0469D3C161C
```

You now have a token contract deployed, with a balance of `1e21` assigned to `accounts[0]`:

```python
>>> token
<Token Contract '0xd495633B90a237de510B4375c442C0469D3C161C'>

>>> token.balanceOf(accounts[0])
1000000000000000000000

>>> token.transfer(accounts[1], 1e18, {'from': accounts[0]})
Transaction sent: 0xb94b219148501a269020158320d543946a4e7b9fac294b17164252a13dce9534
  Gas price: 0.0 gwei   Gas limit: 12000000
  Token.transfer confirmed - Block: 2   Gas used: 51668 (0.43%)

<Transaction '0xb94b219148501a269020158320d543946a4e7b9fac294b17164252a13dce9534'>
```

## Testing

The unit tests included in this mix are very generic and should work with any ERC20 compliant smart contract. To use them in your own project, all you must do is modify the deployment logic in the [`tests/conftest.py::token`](tests/conftest.py) fixture.

To execute the unit tests defined in the tests/ folder, run the following command:

```bash
brownie test -s --update --interactive
```

    -s: prints out to the console output from print()
    --update: only runs the new test cases
    --interactive: breaks into the console. this allows debugging when a failed assert occurs

When calling a Solidity function, the returned result is the txn instead of the value. To get the value, add '.call()' to the end of the function name.

To verify your test coverage, use the following flag:

```bash
brownie test --coverage
```
